We are trying to get on a platform called buyma.
They sent me over some instructions on how to get that going but I am not too familiar with API's and webhook URL
I was wondering if you guys can take a look at this and let me know if it's something you can assist us with.
See below

Next step for connecting BUYMA API,

(1) Please refer to the following documents for application registration and sandbox shop registration

(2) After that, please refer to the following document in the sandbox environment and try
Obtain an access token,
Register products with the product API,
Execute the inventory API,
Create orders in the sandbox application, and try
Execute the order API,
Run the shipping API,
and more!
